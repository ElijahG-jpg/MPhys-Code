# MPhys-Code
Code and plots relevant to work done during my MPhys Project.

"Fibres" folder contains code relevant to working with Multimode Optical Fibres

"Modes Folder" folder contains png plots of all 42 fibre propagation invariant modes generated from the MATLAB code provided to us (found in the "Fibres" folder).

"NN Optimiser Tests" folder contains simple neural network optimisers for different equations. A useful starting point to build more complex models.

"T2 Work" folder contains work done during the second term of Y3, most of the work is with TorchOptics and getting used to coding with fields and neural networks.

"Phase Mask Work" contains work done primarily during T3, Y3. After being temporarily moved to working on free space propagation and phase masks for MPLCs instead of fibres. Tilt_Optimiser.ipynb contains the most recent code with a working axial optimiser for a tilt phase mask.
